# Rock-Paper-Scissors

function computerPlay (line 2-11) creates random number from 0-2 and returns Rock(0), Paper(1) and Scissors(2) Note: Made sure to put first letter upper case for user readability appearance.
function playRound (line 14-36) plays one game, and returns if you draw/win/lose and why in a string.
function playerPrompt (line 39-48) prompts player to input rock/paper/scissors then converts it to lowercase before changing the first character to upper case to match computer.
function game (line 50-91) uses a for loop to play until one player tallies 5 points, each round returns the current score and who won that round and why.
NOTE: currently have to play through devTools (Ctrl + Shift + i) by typing in console game(); (will add html and css in future for playability)
