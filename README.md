# Rock-Paper-Scissors

function computerPlay (line 2-11)<br/> Creates random number from 0-2 and returns Rock(0), Paper(1) and Scissors(2) <br/>Note: Made sure to put first letter upper case for user readability appearance.<br/><br/><br/>
function playRound (line 14-36)<br/>Plays one game, and returns if you draw/win/lose and why in a string.<br/><br/><br/>
function playerPrompt (line 39-48)<br/>Prompts player to input rock/paper/scissors then converts it to lowercase before changing the first character to upper case to match computer.<br/><br/><br/>
function game (line 50-91)<br/>Uses a for loop to play until one player tallies 5 points, each round returns the current score and who won that round and why.<br/><br/><br/>
NOTE: currently have to play through devTools (Ctrl + Shift + i) by typing in console game(); (will add html and css in future for playability)<br/><br/><br/>
